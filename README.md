## 📖 About The Project

**HarmonicWave** is a concept website for a high-end music production company. This project was built as part of the **Webzenith Solutions 100 Days Bootcamp (Week 9)** to demonstrate the power of **Static Site Generation (SSG)** combined with modern, cinematic UI design.

The goal was to move beyond simple layouts and create an **immersive user experience** using advanced animation libraries and a strict, professional design system.

### ✨ Key Features

* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Flawless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* **🌙 Strict Dark Mode:** A carefully curated "Deep Teal" & "Electric Blue" color palette.
